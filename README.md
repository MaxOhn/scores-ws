# scores-ws

<!-- cargo-rdme start -->

Fetches all osu! scores from the api and sends them through websockets.

### Usage

1. Download the [latest release]

2. Input your client id and secret for the osu!api in `config.toml` and modify
   the rest of the config to your liking.

3. Run `scores-ws`

4. Connect to `scores-ws` via websocket at `ws://{ip addr of your config}:{port of your config}`
   and listen for scores. Check out the [examples] folder for some examples.

### How it works

`scores-ws` uses your osu!api client id & secret to fetch from the [scores endpoint].
Cursor management, score deduplication, rate limiting, and everything else is
handled automatically!

To connect to the websocket, `scores-ws` requires you to send an initial message.
That message may either contain
- the string `"connect"` in which case it'll start off sending you all scores it
  has fetched so far (in its history).
- a score id in which case it'll send you all scores from that score id onwards.

At any point you can send the string `"disconnect"` to the websocket. This will
make the websocket respond with a score id and close the connection. This score
id may be used later on to resume from with a new websocket connection.
Alternatively, you can just use a score id from a score you recently received
from the websocket and ignore this disconnect-message hassle.

Since `scores-ws` runs separately, it allows you to have downtime on your actual
app without missing any scores; at least assuming there won't be more scores than the
configured history length during the downtime.
